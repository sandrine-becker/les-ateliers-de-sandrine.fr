# Code for les-ateliers-de-sandrine.fr

This site is developed with [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) an some plugins.

It is placed under MIT License [see LICENSE file](LICENSE.md).

## Using this site as a template

Before using this site as a template, you'd better know that it is largely opinionated by my beliefs in performance.

Jekyll is great at generating static site, but it lacks some optimization on the assets side (js, css, images).

That's what I choose to use Jekyll in a complex deploy mode because I use [plugins not supported by Github Pages](https://help.github.com/articles/using-jekyll-plugins-with-github-pages/)

That's why this site has to be generated locally (or on a well configured server) and then pushed to github pages.
